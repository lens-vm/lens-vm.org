LensVM is a data migration/transformation engine powered by bi-directional lenses. This work is based on the [Cambria]() project by Ink&Switch. 

LensVM uses bi-directional lenses, written in WebAssembly for portability to transform data from one shape to another. This project houses a collection of specifications and implementations to realize the full goal of LensVM. This project relies on [Content Identified]() data models, [JSON-Schema](), and (maybe) [Ceramic Network]() for data consistency and schema registration.

LensVM design is heavily influenced by [proxy-wasm]() which is a WebAssembly based module/plugin framework for extending network proxy behaviour and functionality. 

LensVM is devloped in the open, using a community-first approach, and supported by [Source Network](https://source.network).
