LensVM is a data migration/transformation engine powered by bi-directional lenses. This work is based on the [Cambria](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/) project by Ink&Switch. 

LensVM uses bi-directional lenses, written in WebAssembly for portability to transform data from one shape to another. This project houses a collection of specifications and implementations to realize the full goal of LensVM. This project relies on [Content Identified](https://github.com/multiformats/cid) data models, [JSON-Schema](https://json-schema.org/) & [Cue](https://cuelang.org/) for schema definition, and some kind decentralized schema registration.

LensVM design is heavily influenced by [proxy-wasm](https://github.com/proxy-wasm) which is a WebAssembly based module/plugin framework for extending network proxy behaviour and functionality. 

LensVM is devloped in the open, using a community-first approach, and supported by [Source Network](https://source.network).
